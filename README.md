# ZK Proof Supply Chain Mapping â€“ Example Report

This repository contains an example research report I've compiled on the Zero-Knowledge Proof infrastructure and supply chain landscape.

## Contents

- `1.png` to `12.png`: Informational screenshots and references used in the research process.
- `ZK Proof Supply Chain Mapping the Race (very simple draft).pdf`: The actual report summarizing the analysis.

## Purpose

This is a personal example of how I structure research and visualize complex blockchain infrastructure topics. The repo may evolve with future versions or deeper dives.
